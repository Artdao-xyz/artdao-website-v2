	description: [
		'At Telematic Media Arts in San Francisco, Arvida Byström\'s project PET curated by Alice Scope arrives at a precise cultural moment: five million users subscribed to a single AI girlfriend app in its first month of operation.',
		'The Swedish artist, whose early selfie practice inadvertently predicted Instagram\'s communicative infrastructure, now turns her attention to a more uncomfortable form of self-documentation—the emotional outsourcing happening between humans and their digital companions.',
		'Byström and Scope unpacked work that refuses the easy moralizing around AI intimacy, instead treating these relationships as symptomatic of economic conditions rather than personal failures.'
