		Byström has worked with an AI-powered sex doll, Harmony, since 2022. The doll cost more than the artist could afford, and the financial strain becomes more significant than its silicone body or programmed cheerfulness. Byström performs with Harmony in semi-intellectual interviews where both wear matching outfits, the artist asking questions the doll answers with corporate enthusiasm. The performance acts as a critique of feminized AI, an examination of projected desire, and a frank acknowledgment of labor relations.

This extends to In The Clouds, where Byström used deepfake websites to generate artificial nudes of herself, then sold them on OnlyFans without disclosure.

		Buyers demanded refunds upon discovering the images weren’t “real,” revealing pornography’s peculiar metaphysics. The images functioned as intended, arousing as designed, yet their algorithmic origin violated an unspoken contract of bodily authenticity.
