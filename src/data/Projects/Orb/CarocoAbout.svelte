		The inaugural O.R.B. exhibition found its ideal home at Caroço, a pioneering Brazilian art
		initiative established in 2022. Since its inception it has been challenging conventional art
		boundaries by focusing on post-contemporary and digital aesthetics as well as supporting a wide
		network of artists with press photos, exhibition spaces and other assistance.

		The union created by O.R.B. at Caroço it's a testament to how these Brazilian artists are
		actively shaping the contemporary art scene it as a collective movement. One that crosses new
		bounds between art, music, fashion and technology and finds its own balance between contemporary
		and traditional practices.
