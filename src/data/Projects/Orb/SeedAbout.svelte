		S.E.E.D (Experimental Singularity In Reverie), founded in 2021 by 9 members, aims to
		revolutionize digital art presentation. Embracing hacker, DIY, and open-source philosophies,
		they use cryptocurrencies as a means, not an end. Their activities include sound events,
		parties, exhibitions, and individual works, all accessible through their DAO in the crypto art
		space.

		S.E.E.D breaks barriers in contemporary art, providing opportunities for artists from the global
		south. In 2023, they organized "CHAPTER 1: Parallel Biome Hypothesis," featuring over 80
		artists. They use crypto to materialize collective will and nurture Brazilian internet culture.

		The collective acknowledges Brazil's significant role in NFTs since Hic Et Nunc's 2021
		emergence, seeing the country as an on-chain art powerhouse. Events like O.R.B are crucial for
		artist interactions and presenting digital art as ART, not SERVICE. While recognizing Brazil's
		structural challenges, S.E.E.D remains optimistic: "We feel that the harvest phase is coming,
		and it will be prosperous." They hope to organize more events like O.R.B frequently, fostering
		growth in the digital art space.
