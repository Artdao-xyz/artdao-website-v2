It is a \'lover and control tool\', reflecting how our digital connections, stripped of boundaries, open new doors to eroticism and sexuality in unexpected ways.'

I seek to create fluid universes through the body as a form of personal healing and redefining identity and expression from the virtual, such as the online world, 3D and avatars.\n\nToday, we all live through screens, and my interest is in how we construct our identity in this virtual space.'

When I discovered 3D, I fell in love with its language, which I use more to create fictions and scenes than for the tool itself.\n\n3D allows me to create worlds and characters, and to explore my identity through avatars that slowly transform, mutating between different elements.\n\nThis virtual interaction becomes a "mirror" that reflects and helps to understand parts of my identity that I can\'t always express in everyday life, anchoring who I am in the virtual world.'

Instead, we see a flexible and transformative identity, allowing for new species of self, uncategorized and constantly changing and redefining.\n\nIn the end, these digital selves not only act as reflections of our inner complexities, but also show us how we might redefine our own humanity in terms that are new and radical.'
