		Hivemind emerged in 2022, aiming to diversify the NFT space. "The entire NFT community was very
		crypto-centric and male-dominated, or it was a highly elitist space making a lot of money," the
		founders noted. They created a more inclusive community through Twitter, Discord, and
		exhibitions.
	</p>
	<p>
		Challenges persist: "Knowing what to do as a collective is challenging; there are many ideas and
		desires." They also struggle with "educating other artists who don't understand NFTs; it's a
		complex world with many terms and market movements that are difficult to explain."
	</p>
	<p>
		Despite this, Hivemind has achieved success: "Being able to mobilize funds and bring many people
		into this world is something we take great pride in." They've provided education and
		opportunities for artists in web3.
	</p>
	<p>
		Looking ahead, they emphasize physical events: "An event that gathers a part of the community is
		good for those who interact with us but may not understand what we do, helping them grasp our
		physical activities."
