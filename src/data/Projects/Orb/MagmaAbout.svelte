		Named for earth-enriching matter, emerged in 2020 during the pandemic. Its founder, initially
		studying NFTs, united multi-disciplinary artists in Brazil, where collective action is common
		due to limited access.
	</p>
	<p>
		The collective started by minting NFTs together, overcoming high fees. They later collaborated
		with RefractionDAO for an exhibition in SÃ£o Paulo, uniting various artists. Magma's influence
		sparked other collectives, significantly impacting artists' lives.
	</p>
	<p>
		Three years on, Magma's legacy continues. Many successful web3 artists passed through the
		collective, a source of pride for members. Their journey involved necessary mistakes, making
		them role models for other collectives and event producers. The O.R.B event is seen as the
		officialization of years of work, showcasing united web3 communities and their creations. Magma
		believes their efforts resonate globally, breaking barriers and providing more connection.
