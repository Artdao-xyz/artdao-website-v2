		'The Offical Reunion Of Brazillians (O.R.B) is an organization created in 2024 with the mission of leveraging initiatives focused on digital art, bringing together artists and collectives who orbit this virtual three-dimensional circle that is the web3 and the diversity found in it.',
		'The unquestionable union of these voices in an authentic and official reunion to checkpoint the achievements but also to celebrate the power of the collective potential. An O.R.B. that represents the interconnection of this circle of people and creatives that keep on expanding around the globe.',
		'Speaking with O.R.B.â€™s curators and representatives from the DAOs, we gain insight into the significance of this gathering: An  affirmation of the collective contribution to digital art in a national context and the breaking down of barriers, placing Brazil as the hub for the evolution of contemporary digital art.'
