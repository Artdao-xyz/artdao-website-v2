		'ORB, from the acronym Official Reunion Of Brazilians, an organization created in 2024 with the aim of leveraging initiatives focused on art, more specifically cryptoart. Bringing together artists who orbit this virtual three-dimensional circle that is the web3 universe, and the diversity found in its 360ยบ.',
		'It was born as a response to a current creative anxiety, expressing itself as the unquestionable union of these voices in an authentic and official reunion that gives focus to those who have believed most in their potential. Standing as a pilar, or rather an ORB, as an element that represents the interconnection of all the concentric circles of people, beings and energies that expands infinitely.',
		'By making the O.R.B official, the artists are affirming their contribution in a national context and at the forefront of global digital art. An essential claim for breaking down these barriers and making Brazil official as a hub for the evolution of contemporary art.'
