		responses: [
			{
				artist: 'femzor',
				response: [
					'The increase in the number of collectives on the Brazilian art scene is the result of a need for collaboration, support and personal connection between artists. These collectives are not just groups, they are complex bonds of passion. Together, these artists transcend borders, reaching a diverse audience.'

				artist: 'occulted',
				response: [
					"I don't think there are many artistic collectives involved in cryptoart, but the ones that do exist were and are important for the official meeting that we want to build now. We've been talking about the impact of web3 technologies in countries of the global south, and it wouldn't be any different in Brazil."

		question: 'The concept of this drop seems to be quite vindicating, how important is that?',
		responses: [
			{
				artist: 'femzor',
				response: [
					'The audacity of this drop highlights the authenticity and bravery of Brazilian artists. By making O.R.B official, the artists are asserting their contribution in a national context and at the forefront of global digital art. This claim is essential for breaking down these barriers and making Brazil official as a centre for the evolution of contemporary art.'

				response: [
					"We've been hearing about web3 here since 2020, but for the few early adopters who have had the courage to move these initiatives to reverberate this knowledge in our country, I believe that milestones such as our officialisation will generate yet another checkpoint for us to think about what the future might look like for Brazilian digital art."
