		'Cloud storage, blockchain immutability, and promises of data immortality all reflect digital culture\'s obsession with permanence. This mindset faces a direct challenge from artists who deliberately embrace entropy and digital erosion.',
		'This countermovement treats corruption and decay as critical practices, rejecting preservation in favor of degradation. Their work exposes a fundamental contradiction at the heart of digital culture: systems that promise eternity operate in a universe governed by entropy.',
		'This is not merely an aesthetic preference but a calculated form of resistance against technological determinism and the institutional power structures that demand permanence.'
