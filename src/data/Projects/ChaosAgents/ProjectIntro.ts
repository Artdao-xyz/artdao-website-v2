        'Digital art has long served as a crucible for conceptual experimentation, where computation, probability, and algorithmic logic combine to generate aesthetic forms grounded in chance and indeterminacy. Emerging techniques of the 21st century—generative algorithms, audio-reactive visuals, glitch aesthetics, digital automatism, and interactive systems—extend this lineage. They challenge the idea of singular artistic authorship through intentional acts of collaboration and uncertainty.',
        'Embracing unpredictability, digital artists enact philosopher Gilles Deleuze\'s idea of "thinking from the outside." Working from the margins, they trouble entrenched notions of creative control through strategies of randomness and interference. In turn, chaos within the digital framework becomes a form of resistance, where possibility functions as a currency of unbound creative potential.'
