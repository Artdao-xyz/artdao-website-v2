		Perfect Loop is an artist whose name suggests precision, but whose practice embraces error, drift, and the unpredictable. Working under this self-aware alias, he treats accidents not as problems to fix but as openings for exploration. His work unfolds through technical experimentation with computational imagery—feedback loops, glitch aesthetics, layered effects, and rhythmic iteration. Using tools like TouchDesigner and After Effects, he allows the process to lead, often discovering the work through the act of making it.

		His visuals echo the sensory logic of digital interfaces while carrying a kind of emotional imprint of the software itself. Each piece feels marked by the tools that shaped it, as if holding onto a residual memory of their operations. Rather than execute a fixed idea, Perfect Loop stays open to surprise. His chaotic aesthetic doesn't chase resolution. It invites disruption, drawing the viewer into a space where attention lingers just a little longer.
