<p>Wendi Yan (b. 1999, Beijing) constructs speculative epistemologies through research-driven worldbuilding and metafictional simulation, using CGI, game engines, and documentary practices to probe and play with the artifice of knowledge. Her work—spanning films, interactive media, and fictional archival installations—examines the embodied challenges of facing alien epistemic systems across time. Staging fiction to investigate what constitutes the real, she models metaphysical instruments, animates epistemological creatures, and engineers virtual environments governed by counterfactual logics.</p>
