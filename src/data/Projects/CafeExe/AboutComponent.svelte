<p>For Devconnect in Buenos Aires, Artdao and Serpentine's Future Art Ecosystems present Café.exe, an exhibition marking a soft launch of PCO, a new framework for incubating and funding the most exciting contemporary art practices.</p>
<br/>
<p>Curated by Alice Scope and featuring works by Alice Bucknell, Frenetik Void, Kevin Peter He, Kim Laughton, Theo Triantafyllioist, Wendi Yan and Yuehao Jiang. Café.exe examines the internet's shift from an anarchic counterculture to what Douglas Rushkoff now calls "techno-feudalism". The seven featured artists ask what we misunderstood about the internet from the start.</p>
<br/>
<p>Instead of mourning its collapse, the exhibition revisits the cyber café as the original interface between networked ideals and social reality—a prototype for collective access that was never fully realized.</p>
<br/>
<p>Opening November 18th from 9pm at Valeries Factory in collaboration with Refraction</p>
