		As gentrification spreads through the heart of Lisbon, spaces for raves have become increasingly scarce, turning these gatherings into acts of resistance against the city’s transformation. In response, communities have taken refuge in warehouses on the outskirts, where keeping the rave scene alive is both a collective struggle and a statement of defiance.

  <p>RAVE brought together a selection of these DJs headlined by Nídia, a globally recognized force in contemporary music and a key member of PRÍNCIPE, a record label dedicated to reflect the musical rhythms of the African diaspora such as 
uptempo kuduro, kizomba and tarraxinha.</p>

  <p>She was joined by Ecstasya, a Lisbon-based producer and DJ known internationally for her energetic sets and innovative productions as well as forming a key part of the new Lisbon underground scene.</p>
