Under the intoxicating burst of fantasy and the deafening sound of the bass Las Raras (The Rare Ones) find a place of belonging, we sediment counterculture, devising mythologies, and practicing our own rituals. The party enables our existence through enjoyment, we unleash sensuality beyond the morality of good manners. In fact, we shit on good manners and modesty, we built a monstrous and strident family functional to its members and not to the cis-tem. 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗵𝗮𝗿𝗱𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗺𝗼𝘀𝘁 𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿 𝘀𝗼𝗳𝘁𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀. Now in the blinding brightness of the sun, Las Raras gather around a glass table to continue our histrionic exchanges until we deplete the substances that alienate us a little from the hostility that surrounds us. And, if as the days go by, the post-party anguish affects us, we will know how to accompany and take care of ourselves in our vulnerability within our chosen family until the next time ecstasy summons us. And even if they don’t want us, we will continue to be scandalous occupying all the spaces we want to because Las Raras don’t know about fear.',
