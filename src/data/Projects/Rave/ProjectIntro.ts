	description: [
		"Underground rave culture emerged as a radical response to social constraints, creating safe spaces for uninhibited self-expression and collective experimentation.",
		'These spaces have evolved with the emergence of an increasingly digital age, becoming core sites of creativity as a new generation of artists finds a connection with its core themes and inspirations which they disperse through graphics,  fashion, visuals and installations.',
		"RAVE explores this new intersection, examining how contemporary digital art inherits and transforms the aesthetic language of rave culture through different communities which are both hyperlocalised and underground whilst increasingly globally interconnected.  The exhibition brought together artists, DJs and performers for a takeover of Higher Ground in Lisbon."
