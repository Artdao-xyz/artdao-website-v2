		'In the eyes of a conservative society, the liberation of self-expression is seen as something diabolical and aberrant. Rave culture emerged as an inversion of this logic, a collective search for liberating spaces where the normal boundaries of conventional life, intimacy and bodies could be free to experiment, unbound from the constraints of normally imposed conventions.',
		'As these spaces intersect with contemporary internet culture they take root within a digital imaginary which disperses across new terrains and enters into our screens.'
