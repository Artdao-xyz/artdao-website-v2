		When authoritarian forces consolidate power, marginalized communities are often the first targets of creative suppression. But censorship isn’t always overt. It also manifests in subtle, systemic ways that demand robust strategies of archival resistance. In this context, blockchain technology emerges as bothan ally and an adversary. While it promises indelible preservation, it operates within systems shaped by the same economic forces that have long excluded queer artists.

		This contradiction lies at the heart of the issue: decentralization could, in theory, protect cultural artifacts from erasure, yet blockchain’s market-driven ecosystem often mirrors the same hierarchies as traditional institutions. The tension between technological potential and social reality reminds us that no archival tool is neutral. Every solution carries the imprint of its society, including its assumptions, exclusions, and blind spots.
