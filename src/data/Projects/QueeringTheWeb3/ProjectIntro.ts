        'The foretold utopia of Web3 reveals itself as a contentious landscape—one where queer expression both flourishes and falls victim to praticable patterns of erasure. The promise of identity protection and direct patronage for marginalized artists hasn’t stopped the technology from replicating homophobic power structures. Today, queer artists remain vulnerable to market downturns that render their work instantly disposable.',
        'The friction between blockchain’s imagined socialist potential and the fractured social realities it operates within demands deeper interrogation. How artwork is preserved, valued, and collected in digital space must be understood within a tech economy that remains structurally heteronormative. Exploring these tensions through the lens of queer subjects not only exposes the blockchain’s limits as an archival system, but also highlights the adaptability of queer self-expression. For queer artists, Web3 is less a haven than a practice of persistence and strategic ephemerality.'
