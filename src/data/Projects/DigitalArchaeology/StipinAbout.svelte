		Spitnip's journey with pixel art began out of necessity—a slow computer made most digital tools unusable. His story underscores how digital art practices remain deeply tied to material conditions and access. What might have been a limitation instead sparked a lasting affinity, rooted in childhood memories of pegboard games and classic titles like Monkey Island and Zelda. What continues to captivate Spitnip is the challenge of distilling complex imagery into elemental pixels—transforming technological constraint into creative precision.

		His work blends personal nostalgia with cultural heritage, drawing from the archaeological iconography of Northwest Argentina (NOA) and the emotional resonance of vanished environments. By reimagining these elements in digital form, Spitnip bridges past and present, positioning pixel art as both an expressive medium and a quiet resistance to today's hyperreal, visually saturated landscape.
