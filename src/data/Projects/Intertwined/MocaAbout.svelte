		Museum Of Crypto Art joined Intertwined to present “Making it 24/7” a digital interactive
		experience that lead the users to a digital gallery.
	</p>
	<p>
		Making It 24/7 discusses the individualistic and hyper-personal nature of artworks created by
		"children of the Internet's genius." These works reflect the richness that comes from exposure
		to the Internet world.
	</p>
	<p>
		Though the artworks may seem loosely linked, they represent an important 21st-century
		psychological phenomenon that has emerged through the Internet's influence on our children and
		our own internal worlds.
