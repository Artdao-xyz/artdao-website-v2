		name: 'CYTOKINESIS',
		artist: 'POSTMODERN BOT',
		image: cyto,
		about:
			'Cytokinesis is the final stage of cell division, a process essential for the growth, development, and regeneration of living organisms. Cytokinesis involves the division of a single cell into two new cells, resulting in an increase in cell population. Similarly, transhumanism envisions the expansion and diversification of human potential through the integration of technology. Just as cytokinesis represents a fundamental transformation and growth of a cell, transhumanism advocates for the transformative potential of technology to fundamentally enhance and reshape the human experience.'

		name: 'CONCUSSION',
		artist: 'Tomas Jones',
		image: concussion,
		about:
			"CONCUSSION is a head injury that temporarily affects brain functioning. The electrical currents emitted by the machine intertwine with the neural pathways, symbolizing the disruption and alteration of normal brain activity caused by a concussion. This fusion of elements signifies the influence of the machine on the brain's cognitive and sensory processes, distorting the regular functioning of neural connections."

		about:
			"The purpose of this project is to ask the opposite question to 'where is the utility of art?'. It takes useful objects and banishes them from their field of utility just to ask us: and now ... where is the value of these useless objects? This project tries to remind us that the beauty of things lies precisely in their freedom of meaning, in their forgotten mystery, in their resistance of being used."

		name: 'THROUGH THE KEYHOLE',
		artist: 'Meelayya',
		image: keyhole,
		about:
			'Through the Keyhole depicts an intriguing concept where the theme of technology and the presence of numerous eyes looking directly at the viewer converge. The artwork serves as a symbolic representation of the ever-growing role of technology in our lives and the impact it has on our perception and interactions. The eyes featured in the artwork serve as a metaphorical reflection of the constant observation and surveillance facilitated by technology. They represent the pervasive presence of technology in our daily lives, where cameras, sensors, and interconnected devices monitor and gather information about us.'

			"'Enchanted Fusion' seeks to ignite imaginations and inspire a renewed appreciation for the interconnectedness of all things. It serves as a reminder that in the quest for progress and innovation, the magic of symbiosis can guide us towards a more balanced and harmonious coexistence between humanity, nature, and technology."

The biomorphic sculpture symbolizes the transient nature of thoughts and emotions, emphasizing the significance of empathy and sharing in fostering meaningful human connections.'

The lost toys, all that which transformed us without knowing it, and without being aware of it, transforms what is to come.'
