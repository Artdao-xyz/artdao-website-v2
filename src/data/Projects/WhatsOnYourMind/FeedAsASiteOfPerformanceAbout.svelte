		When social media platforms prompt users with questions like what's on your mind? or how are you feeling?, a growing number of artists playfully subvert their intended functionality.

		Here, the feed becomes a live circuit rather than a neutral container. Timing, absence, and adaptation shape meaning as much as what is shown by users. What appears mundane or benign on the surface often functions as cover. Beneath it, more affective or resistant gestures emerge as artists perform, negotiate, and subtly reshape the platform itself.
