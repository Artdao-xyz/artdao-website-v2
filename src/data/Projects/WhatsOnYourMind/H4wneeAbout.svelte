		H4wnee treats his social media presence as fluid and alive, from carefully sequenced stories to strategically timed hiatuses. He uses the platform as an "open studio" that captures emotional states through visual and sonic fragments. For him, social media is a dynamic ecosystem—a performative space where every action is intentional, and algorithmic tools are reimagined as part of his artistic practice.
