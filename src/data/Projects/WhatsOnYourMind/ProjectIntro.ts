	description: [
		'The relentless sirens of social media, and the ecosystems of attention they engender, force digital artists to confront existential questions of creativity, audience, and algorithmic control. For some, these pressures become generative prompts, materializing across a wide range of digital mediums.',
		'In response, artists are remixing the very architecture of social platforms, crafting narratives where engagement and profit become both the medium and the message.',
		'Those working in this emerging tradition deliberately subvert platform boundaries, blending the roles of coder, designer, and hacker. Their public personas are carefully curated, evolving in symbiosis with the platforms themselves. Individual emotions and perspectives dissolve into a collective database—less a digital sounding board than a living organism.',
		'What emerges is a new digital self: distributed, reactive, and endlessly iterated, transforming personal experience into entangled social conditions.'
