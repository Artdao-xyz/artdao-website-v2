		Growing up in Brazil in 1997, Elbi was surrounded by VHS tapes and skate videos characterized by
		their distinctive glitches. While retro technology remained prevalent in Brazilian households
		for many years, Elbi's natural attachment to this aesthetic grew into something more. His
		artistic experimentation with these objects and hardware evolved, particularly focusing on GIF
		loops and still frames extracted from found VHS tapes, which he would later refine using
		contemporary software.

		For Elbi, working with analog video and glitch art embodies the concept itselfâ€”a nostalgic
		journey through technology that bridges his childhood memories with contemporary machinery. This
		approach feels organic to his artistic practice, creating a seamless connection between past and
		present.
