		Elbi attraction to analog machines stems from a deep-rooted nostalgia, influenced by growing up
		with retro technology like CRT TVs, VHS tapes, and early video game consoles. His creative
		process alternates between experimentation with random VHS content and more structured projects
		that start in digital softwares before being processed through analog equipment. Working with
		analog video and glitch art it’s a reflection on the evolution of artistic mediums, creating a
		nostalgic journey. Elbi’s work naturally floats towards exploring and repurposing past
		technologies.
