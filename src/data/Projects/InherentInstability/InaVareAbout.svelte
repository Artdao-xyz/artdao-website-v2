		Captivated by the unpredictability of what we know as analog, Inaâ€™s work embraces the
		imperfections and physicality of old technology. Drawing upon its natural instability to explore
		deeply personal themes.

		While her art begins and ends digitally, the process happens in the unpredictable, tactile space
		of merging analog and digital. Using VHS players, circuit-bent video processors and camcorders
		to create visually layered works. Bridging history with present dialogues of the self to
		reimagine its current possibilities.
