		'The tools of obsolete technology unlock new dimensions in artistic practice, transforming objects of the past into contemporary forms of expression. No longer simply outdated devices, these artefacts become catalysts for creative explorations that bridge new connections between the past and present.',
		'In conversation with Ina Vare, NICØ, and Elbi, we delve into their distinct approaches with obsolete media, from VHS recordings and CRT TVs to analog music and video machines. Together they reveal a shared philosophy in which they see “dead technology”  through a  lens of present creative potential. Where a reactivating and rewiring the past can lead to new insights and works of art.'
