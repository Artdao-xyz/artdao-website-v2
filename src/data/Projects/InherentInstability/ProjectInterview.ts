				text: "There’s something in my personality that keeps me excited about physical mediums. I’ve always enjoyed digital work, but working only with a computer feels too “clean” for me. When I spend long periods in front of a computer, I start to feel anxious and eventually look for ways to get my hands dirty, whether it's gardening, painting, sculpting, or dealing with physical hardware."
			},
			{
				text: 'Analog video technology uses electric currents, which, to me, feel alive—natural, like waves in the sea. There’s a great deal of unpredictability. Factors like temperature and moisture affect the output of my glitch machines, making it feel like working with paint, ink, or plaster. It becomes a conversation with the medium, seeing what we can create together.'

I have a computer, a video mixer, a couple of circuit-bent video processors for creating glitches, VHS players, camcorders, capture devices, and more. My work starts and ends with digital tools, but the magic happens in between with the analog equipment.'

				text: "My lifestyle is pretty busy, so I can’t spend all day in my studio. I've learned to do most of my planning in my head while running errands or going places. When I finally get the chance to work with my gear, I already know what I’m aiming for. There’s still a lot of experimentation involved since the outputs aren’t 100% predictable. However, I’ve been working with my machines and processes for years, so I have a good sense of how to approach them to get the results I want."

		response: [
			{
				text: 'My work is always deeply personal. I explore themes like love, nature, glitches (not just visual ones), female empowerment, and performance art. I create 90% of the footage myself, and if my work involves a female, it’s usually me performing. I strive to create a “hundred-layer cake” in my work. I don’t want my pieces to answer questions or tell a direct narrative; I want them to provoke questions and encourage viewers to explore the layers and discover more.'

		question: 'What do you like about the encounter between digital and analog software?',
		response: [
			{
				text: 'Digital tools have allowed me to showcase my analog work. There are some divine pairs between digital and analog mediums, like processing analog video outputs as GIF loops. Dithering algorithms can add texture to my work, and digital formats allow me to present my work online. In the past, analog video artists had to create complicated setups to exhibit their pieces, and selling them was even more challenging. Now, I can bridge my analog work to digital and bring it to the blockchain, which is super exciting and rewarding because artists create their work to be seen.'

		question: 'Why do you as an artist prefer to use old material instead of new?',

				text: 'Maybe it’s my personality that gets excited about history and old things. In my free time, I can get obsessed with vintage items, old dishes, photographs, and books. It’s a way to explore the future by inspecting history. However, most of my footage is recently made. Sometimes I use older material, but it has to have a personal connection—either an old photograph of me or old footage I filmed years ago.'

			{
				text: "I've always been a fan of vhs/glitch aesthetics, mostly because I've grown up watching skate videos filmed on the Sony VX1000. Even that I was born in 97, retro tech like CRT tvs, 16 bit game consoles and VCRs were very popular in Brazilian houses for a long time, so it was kinda natural to me to get attached to this stuff."

Digital is also very helpful to compose different parts of a song since the timeline on any DAW is easy to read.

Although most people hate it, I really enjoy reading old gear manuals. There is a book that I really enjoy called ‘Electronic music’ by Allen Strange. It was published in 1972 but still proves to be very contemporary in some aspects.'
