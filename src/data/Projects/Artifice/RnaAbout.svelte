		Artifice was formed in partnership with RNA, a collective studio based in Lisbon that unites forward-thinking creatives dedicated to developing interactive experiences and new forms of art via emergent technologies.
	</p>
	<p>
		With innovation and experimentation at its core, the collective comprises 204 NoContentAI, MuLabs and MURO. Together, they help foster a collaborative and dynamic space which provides a wide range of support to a rotating series of resident artists.
	</p>
	<p>
		As part of Artifice, RNA curated a series of installations featuring Apolinário’s  "Parallel U" -  an intimate experience connecting audiences with mirror AI versions of themselves in a parallel universe, alongside the first protoype installation of CROSSLUCID’s Oceanic Whispers.
