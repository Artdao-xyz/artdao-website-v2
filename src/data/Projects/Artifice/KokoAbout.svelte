		In an era where algorithms shape nearly every aspect of life, Psipsikoko emerges as a bold
		artistic exploration by Frenetik Void and Julian Brangold. Rather than resisting the
		increasingly blurred lines between human creativity and artificial intelligence, they embrace
		this ambiguity as a source of artistic potential.
	</p>
	<p>
		Through their work, they challenge the traditional boundaries between authentic and algorithmic
		creation, crafting a playful digital universe where human imagination and technological
		processes intertwine. Psipsikoko invites viewers to journey beyond conventional distinctions,
		suggesting that in our digital age, the merger of human and machine creativity opens up
		unprecedented possibilities for artistic expression.
