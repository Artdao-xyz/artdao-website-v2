	description: [
		'Through diverse series of works across two venues, the exhibition sought to question how technology as artificial system can be seen to drive a disconnection from ‘nature’ whilst at the same time, paradoxically, revealing deeper truths about the self as ‘a fiction which through habit we come to believe’.',
		'Drawing on pre-internet philosophical inquiries into the boundaries between nature, artifice, and humanity the exhibition brought these into dialogue with contemporary artists working in the current age of AI and mass digitisation. Developed across a series of installations, exhibitions, talks and workshops, Artifice set out to explore the emergent tensions between technology, fiction, and our lived experience.'
