		To recreate the Psipsikoko world's atmosphere, the production team sourced materials from
		second-hand stores that were characterized by their chaotic organization. One particular store,
		located in what felt like a basement, had furniture arranged in towering piles - chairs, tables,
		rugs and smaller objects stacked haphazardly. Navigating through these spaces, filled with
		obsolete items and furniture, almost felt like being transported directly into a surrealist
		world distant from our everyday reality.
	</p>
	<p>
		The entrance doors to these stores served almost as portals into the Psipsikoko universe as
		these immersive experiences ultimately enabled us to successfully recreate this unique
		atmosphere and transport visitors fully into the artistsâ€™ visions through a carefully curated
		adventure that captured the essence of the project.
