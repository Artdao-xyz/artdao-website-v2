		Through personal travels and meticulous collection of natural resources, Okytomo has developed a
		unique library of 3D assets which interweave between his own travels and environments that
		fascinate him.
	</p>
	<p>
		The core of his work lies in crafting mysterious and immersive 3d worlds from these assets.
		Exploring the transitory moments of dusk and dawn to bring to life sensory portals -
		transporting viewers into a state of contemplation which invites viewers to disconnect from
		everyday reality.
	</p>
	<p>
		Sound plays a fundamental role in these compositions, with Okytomo collaborating with other
		artists to create soundscapes that complement and amplify the visual impact of his works
		creating a multi-sensory experience.
