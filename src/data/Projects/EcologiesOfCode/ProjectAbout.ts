Their work emphasizes creating contemplative and ambient experiences while collaborating with sound design artists to give it more immersion. Drawing inspiration from water in many different states and places in nature and how they associated each one with emotional states, using real-world references as starting points for reinterpretations. The objective is to craft environments that invite viewers to slow down and reflect.'

Oky’s work features landscapes at dawn or dusk, capturing the mysterious ambiance. Looking to create harmonious scenes that invite the viewers to a state of reflection. Sound also plays a crucial role, often created in collaboration with sound design artists, to enhance the immersive experience. Using 3D scans from places they visited, they integrate real-world elements into the digital compositions. Inspiration comes from various sources, including travel, personal experiences, and a desire to escape from reality. Ultimately, the goal is to create enigmatic works that capture attention and provoke emotions.'

	text: 'Hypereikon started working on environments when they were living in the southern part of Chile. They started recording and working with sounds from the nature. They were deeply inspired by the humid environments where you can find a symbiosis of mosses, lichens, and many species that can be confusing to identify. Then they incorporated AI into their art, focusing on generative process to create images that blend reality and fantasy. They explore the concept of time and the archaeological within the natural world, aiming to create immersive experiences. Recently they’ve been using AI models to blend large amounts of data, continuously reinterpreting past work with new looks. The constant environmental changes, taught them to appreciate various forms of nature and to explore its boundaries, integrating various materials like plastic and metal to rethink the idea of a nature influenced by human impact.'
