		Drawing inspiration from water's diverse forms in nature - from serene lakes to turbulent seas -
		Joaquina crafts digital environments that serve as places for contemplation.
	</p>
	<p>
		Whether capturing the reflective stillness of a lake or the raw energy of ocean waves, each
		piece invites viewers to pause and reflect. This "slow media" approach encourages viewers to
		step back from their frenetic daily lives and find moments of serenity.

		Developing her work across wider collaborations with sound designers and physical installations,
		Joaquina creates environments where soft visuals and calming sounds work in harmony with the
		digital code the comprises them to open new pathways to meditating upon our contemporary
		existence.
