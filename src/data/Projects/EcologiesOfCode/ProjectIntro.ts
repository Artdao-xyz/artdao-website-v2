		'The tools of digital technologies open up new pathways to the construction of digital landscapes as symbiotic environments that place the viewer in an immersive relationship with the work of art.  Going beyond ideas of an artwork as  a single framed image towards a conception of a living piece which places the viewer and wider ecological systems in dialogue with a creative practice.',
		'Drawing inspiration and materials from the natural world and what surrounds them,  Joaquina Salgado, Okytomo and Hyperikon share insights into their own creative practice and how they approach develop works that inhabit a new space between nature and technology, organic system and machine.'
