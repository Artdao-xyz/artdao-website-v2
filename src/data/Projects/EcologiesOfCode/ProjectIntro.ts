		"When we look at an image of an environment, it can evoke a range of emotions. It's in this realm of feelings that three artists - Joaquina, Okytomo, and Hypereikon - create their work, crafting landscapes that go beyond the visual and resonate with the viewer.",
		"For this three artists whose works are more than just representations of scenes; they're gateways to immersive experiences that challenge our perception and stimulate our imagination.",
		'Inspired by the natural world and what surrounds them, they developed a close relationship with the art of contemplation and immersion. In this conversation, they shared insights into their creative process, revealing their sources of inspiration and the techniques they use to bring to life worlds that exist between reality and dreams.'
