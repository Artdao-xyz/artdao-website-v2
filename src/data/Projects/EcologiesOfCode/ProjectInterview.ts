				text: "For me, water has something very interesting because it evokes the sensation of how we imagine and at the same time, each structure or type of water evokes different stages. For example, if I talk about spring waters or clear and fresh waters, a whole cataract of images that are already inside our imagination come pre-set. That are very different from when we talk about turbulent waters, deep waters, swamp waters and has all other imaginary that just by mentioning these words, they bring a lot of ideas, images and memories that are in the unconscious. Then, within how we imagine, and speaking at a human level, there is a lot of relation with water, it takes you to a stage instantly. So there, although water is a physical material of the real world of nature, it has a very close link with the world of fantasy, of imagination and leaves a lot of room for free interpretation. In conclusion, in my work, I take references from the real world but as a starting point to later put together other things. I also work a lot with 3D scans. It's a tool I use a lot, scanning objects and then processing them in Unreal and that also has a direct link with the work. Taking objects out of the real world and transferring them to virtual scenarios."

But yes, I try to look for references of works that don't have to do with digital art and see where that can take me. Being by the sea, for example, always takes me to a trance state that makes me come up with 10 ideas and I analyze what it generates me to be next to certain water, for example, what does it generate me to be in front of a lake? Or what does it generate me to be in front of the sea? I look for different types of stadiums and I can write a little bit, see how to translate that into images."

It's not like having complete control of the render, it's not as chaotic as working with an image generator model, where you really have no idea what the result will be, but there is something in between, because as you are working with real time and many times the things I do are interactive, thinking about the most installation, you draw the possible ways for people to play or interact with the work but then something always breaks or unexpected things happen, like changing the computer and everything stops working. So that relationship of harmony, working with art with machines, one has to be prepared for that balance to be broken at some point."

But I add other personal things to it. Let's say, I work a lot with light. I always work in those hours that are a sunset or sunrise, where that landscape looks mysterious or as if it hides something. What I mean is to seek to relax the person with a looped landscape, with a looping wind, which moves a little, but keeps your gaze captive, but active, in a way. And I look for a reflection there, how in that hour everything is bathed in a special color where a landscape that could possibly be normal and go unnoticed, has something mysterious. I'm looking for reflection, I'm looking for you to stare and think about something. I don't know, I don't know if you are interested in whatever you have in your head there, but it's like a window to reflection, to something beyond."

And later, with my film studies, I reinforced even more that of composition and visual harmony. So yes, I love it. I don't use anything specific, I don't use compositional tools and I try to generate that through the objects and the way things are arranged so that your gaze is trapped in the work. It's not that I have some strange method or a super-thought-out perspective, but I use very basic tools, the GRID, the Golden Ratio and not much more. I do dedicate an important amount of time to it because I want the viewer's gaze to remain there.

My first works I do, but then I teamed up with a friend of mine, a friend and another friend, who do the sound for the works. I pass him the directions: No, I want it to sound like this. It's almost always a base sound, I tell him: I want it to sound like you were there. First I tell them that and almost always then they are artists, so I tell them: I want a melody or something to go with it. But well, I'm kind of picky, I end up getting on Discord with them and I use them as a tool there and they do what I want. So the music has a weight. You can't always hear it, at least when I put it in samples, because to make digital works that are put on screen it's difficult to hear the sound, but it also has the same objective. It is a looped melody that resolves to emphasize that there is something else. I love to generate this enigma, to see the work and feel that there is something else hidden in it. That's why there is fog and there are these times when things look different, always to emphasize this."

Later, my film studies reinforced my understanding of composition and visual harmony. ",
					"So while I don’t use any complicated, rigid compositional tools, I do work with basics like the grid and the Golden Ratio to make sure the viewer’s gaze stays anchored in the work. It's less about following a specific method and more about an intuitive process where the arrangement of objects organically pulls the viewer in. It’s something I put a lot of thought and time into because, ultimately, I want people to feel the same magnetism I did when I was a kid, being drawn into an image and unable to look away."

					'For us, it’s about a continuous digestion and transformation of images. Over the years, we’ve collected and synthesized a large library of visuals, constantly redirecting them through new AI models to see how they can regenerate and evolve.',
					'This process creates a natural coherence between images, even as they change. There’s a sense of harmony that comes from allowing the images to feed back into themselves—an organic flow that gives them balance even when they are abstract or ambiguous. It’s about seeing how far the image can stretch, how much it can regenerate and still remain captivating.'

					"Before I dive into digital creation, I spend time with analog tools—sketching and writing. When I move into the interactive space, I carefully consider how I want people to engage with the environment. In more contemplative works, I opt for minimal actions that encourage stillness, like in my game 'Simulación de lo Esencial', where players simply guide a small fish around.",

					'Sound plays a huge role in immersing the viewer, although I don’t always work on the sound myself. Early on, I did, but now I collaborate with friends who specialize in sound design. I usually give them direction, like: “I want it to sound as though you’re physically in the environment,” and then build from there. I’m very hands-on with them, sometimes even hopping onto Discord to work through the nuances in real-time. ',
					'The sound, just like the visuals, often loops, creating a sense of continuity that draws people in without jarring transitions. The melody and atmosphere support the idea that there’s something deeper hidden within the work. Another technique I use is the loop itself. Visually, I love creating scenes that slowly repeat without any sharp cuts, which makes the viewer stay longer, almost trapped in that space. It’s subtle, but these tools—the looping visuals and sound—are key in generating the immersive, enigmatic experience I want the viewer to feel.'

					'We aim for a sense of immersion by constructing landscapes that feel alive yet unfamiliar. This immersiveness often comes from the landscape itself—it’s a place that doesn’t exist, but feels as if it could. Sometimes, sound plays a crucial role in deepening the experience. We think about sound not just in human terms, but from non-human perspectives: What might an insect hear when it emerges from its shell? What is the auditory experience of a plant?',
					'We also play with scale, blurring the lines between micro and macro worlds. Are you looking at something tiny, like a spore, or something vast, like a planet? This ambiguity in scale enhances the immersive quality of the work. Over the years, we’ve also explored the idea of emergence—the patterns and meanings that arise when large datasets are fed into AI models. We let the AI generate systems of its own, and through trial and error, we find the images that truly captivate us.'
