				text: "In general, the environments I create are always related to the aquatic, to the material of water. On the one hand, I'm interested in the digital representation, which is very difficult to generate: simulated fluids that really look good. So, suddenly, in many of the spaces I build, this element is present and the question is, how to represent it so that it continues to evoke what the element of water brings? Perhaps without resorting to super precise representations, since my main tool is Unreal, a video game engine that runs in real time and is not a software that looks super realistic, as can be a render in Maya or other software. I think that the environments I build always seek to generate a stage of general contemplation."

				text: "And I would say that what I do is a mixture of both. There is a representation of the physical world through my gaze and the framing that I choose to create in that digital world, but it is still a reflection of reality or at least I try to reach something similar to say: Look, that's from here, from the earth. But I add other personal things to it. Let's say, I work a lot with light. I always work in those hours that are a sunset or sunrise, where that landscape looks mysterious or as if it hides something. What I mean is to seek to relax the person with a looped landscape, with a looping wind, which moves a little, but keeps your gaze captive, but active, in a way. And I look for a reflection there, how in that hour everything is bathed in a special color where a landscape that could possibly be normal and go unnoticed, has something mysterious. I'm looking for reflection, I'm looking for you to stare and think about something."

				text: "Something that also interests us a lot in this process is that it is like a great digestion of images, there is an image in constant transmutation, one could say. Something that has caught our attention from the beginning is how these same images that we have been synthesizing and that we have made over the years, we have been redirecting them and giving them constant feedback and taking the idea that we had, I don't know, three years ago and reinterpreting it again with tools that now can give very different results. So that causes a certain kind of coherence and also helps us in a search to see how much more this image can be stretched, how much more this image can regenerate itself and feed back."
