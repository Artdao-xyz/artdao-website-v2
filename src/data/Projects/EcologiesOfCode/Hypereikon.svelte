		Hypereikon started working on environments when they were living in the southern part of Chile.
		They started recording and working with sounds from the nature. They were deeply inspired by the
		humid environments where you can find a symbiosis of mosses, lichens, and many species that can
		be confusing to identify. Then they incorporated AI into their art, focusing on generative
		process to create images that blend reality and fantasy. They explore the concept of time and
		the archaeological within the natural world, aiming to create immersive experiences. Recently
		theyâ€™ve been using AI models to blend large amounts of data, continuously reinterpreting past
		work with new looks. The constant environmental changes, taught them to appreciate various forms
		of nature and to explore its boundaries, integrating various materials like plastic and metal to
		rethink the idea of a nature influenced by human impact.
