Also in fantastic creatures from different stories that I heard in other lives and wanted so much to have. These pieces were created with a pinch of Magical Realism, made with mixed techniques”.',

        about: '“Saltar el molinete or asaltar el molinete is a work that takes a very figurative image of everyday life: the action of jumping the turnstile of the train when there is no money to pay. It is a physical, everyday action that I try to transfer to the virtual world, where both worlds, the physical and the digital, are not so distant. I see them in constant dialogue, as a single reality that cannot be separated.\n\nIn the work, I include coordinates of Plaza Constitución, a well-known station, and the Argentine sun, which symbolizes that almost natural action of “jumping the turnstile”. This image represents the reality of many people in the south, for whom this gesture is a daily necessity. Transportation is the main means of getting to the capital and to work, and this action, so common, becomes a symbol of resistance. In doing so, the work also frames the sun of the Argentine flag, as if it were an accomplice of this action that is repeated every day.”',

        about: '“Influencer is a work that reflects a little on the myth that artists must show their face, adopt a pose. It is something that, in one way or another, crosses us all. It is a satire on how we build an image and take it to the extreme, exaggerating it.\n\nThe work has fundamental elements, such as the way the cell phone is held and the misaligned proportions between the head and the phone. Those details seek to maximize the gestures and that pose, or perhaps that image that we feel we have to sell to the industry”.',

        about: '“Prohibido contar is a work that includes several pieces that represent people\'s bodies, and at the same time, it refers to something deeper, such as the political issues of my country.  Although it is sometimes said that art speaks for itself, I am interested in getting involved and expressing what is going on, especially at a time when freedom of expression is being debated.\n\nThe work, in this sense, is a critique. There is a destroyed street, fragments of bodies and elements that refer to cameras with facial recognition, which seem to invade our privacy. All this seeks to question those structures of control and modern dictatorships, showing the cutting of our bodies as a metaphor of how we are observed and limited. The importance of the body in my work is key, because it is the vehicle through which I try to convey the message”.',
