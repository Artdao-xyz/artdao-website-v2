        Vidal's artistic evolution began at a young age, but it was through automatism that he found a framework to define his creative approach. By suspending logic and conscious control, he embraced a method that allowed the imaginary and the fantastic to surface freely—unfiltered by critical judgment.

        Today, technology extends this methodology, acting as a conduit to the unconscious. For Vidal, digital tools are not just functional—they are portals into a shared creative field, enabling spontaneous expression and connecting individual impulses to broader aesthetic currents.

        In this space of intuitive making, what others might call errors become for Vidal essential disruptions—openings that deepen the work. By reframing mistakes as material, he bypasses the usual frustrations of precision and perfection, unlocking a more expansive and fearless mode of exploration.
