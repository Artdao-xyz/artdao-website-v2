This virtual globalism is a powerful tool for connection and has engendered artistic currents that move fluidly across time and space. These connections, however, are not always conscious. Beneath the surface, they can act as quiet guides, drawing seemingly unconnected artists from all corners of the earth to examine like-minded themes and aesthetics.
