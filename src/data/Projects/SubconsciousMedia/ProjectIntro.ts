        'Advancements in digital technology have expanded the possibilities of artistic practice, allowing artists to translate fleeting thoughts, subconscious impulses, and abstract patterns into visible, manipulable forms. Generative AI models, algorithmic design software, and procedural simulation tools allow creators to externalize thought patterns, emotions, and subconscious imagery, transforming ephemeral mental states into tangible digital forms.',
        'These digital gestures extend Jung\'s idea of the collective unconscious into cyberspace, where memes, procedural simulations, and glitch aesthetics act as modern archetypes circulating across time and networks. In this psycho-spatial terrain, digital creation reveals the hidden topography of shared human experience, connecting minds, myths, and affect in a space that is invisible yet palpably collective.'
