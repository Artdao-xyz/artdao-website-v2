		'Set across an old abandoned train depot in Paris’s 19eme , Nonplaces  interrogates a fundamental shift in systems of demarcation - one where digital code dissolves the ability of coordinate points to differentiate objects in space. ',
		'Shifting systems from one of geo-location or ‘global positioning’ to binary partitions in code.  Losing conventional means of distinguishing the original from the copy, and opening instead towards an exploration of sites in which it manifests and replicates. ',
		'In partnership with MOCA, Superchief and MYCE, the exhibition brought together works from 16 artists from around the world across 4 days of ETHCC.'
