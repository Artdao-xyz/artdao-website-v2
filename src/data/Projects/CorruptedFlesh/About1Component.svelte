		Resistance to machine logic emerges through a variety of artistic strategies. Some artists use visceral horror to confront the violent ruptures that take place when flesh is forced into optimization. Others embrace instability and fragmentation to dissolve the boundaries between human and machine. Others still employ satire to expose the grotesque adaptations technology demands of the body.

		The works of Veronika Peshekhonova, Matheus Carvalho, and Tim Høibjerg show what bodies look like under technological strain. They absorb pressure, mutate, and break. Together, their works insist that the digital body gains power in breakdown. Corrupted flesh exposes the friction, rupture, and resistance that smooth technological systems try to erase.
