		'The compromised digital body stands as witness to our technological condition, disrupting sanitized myths of seamless integration between flesh and interface. These artworks reveal sites of conflict where human vulnerability meets machine logic.',
		'Contemporary digital artists deploy strategies of embodied resistance—from visceral body horror to subtle structural absences—each capturing the psychological wounds of our mediated lives. Their work exposes anxiety, alienation, and loss hidden beneath technological progress.',
		'Rejecting both techno-utopian fantasy and shallow technophobia, these pieces embrace damaged, incomplete, glitched bodies as critical responses to technological smoothness. By showing the breaks and grotesque adaptations that progress demands, they insist that despite our fragmented digital selves, we remain vulnerably, undeniably embodied.'
