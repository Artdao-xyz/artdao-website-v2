		'Technical systems are built on assumptions of seamless operation, continuity, and infinite adaptability. As bodies are absorbed into these systems, they are expected to operate according to the same logic of efficiency and optimization. This expectation produces strain rather than harmony. Under such pressure, bodies do not function smoothly. They glitch, mutate, and deteriorate.',
		'The artists gathered here use corruption and transformation as strategies of resistance, positioning the fractured body as a site that confronts the costs of technological smoothness. By staging damage and incompleteness, the works reveal how seamless systems obscure the body\'s materiality and its capacity to resist, foregrounding rupture and grotesque adaptation to assert that the body persists - vulnerable, resistant, and present.'
