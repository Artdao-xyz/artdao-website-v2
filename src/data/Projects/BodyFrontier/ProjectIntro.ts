    'As technology permeates every aspect of modern life, the boundaries between the physical and digital body are growing increasingly blurred. For artists, crafting a digital persona offers mobility, political agency, and the freedom to transcend physical limitations. At this frontier, body, technology, and eroticism fuse into a chimera of subjectivity that forges deep connections with the hybrid spaces we now inhabit.',
    'Software tools empower artists to manipulate bodies, transforming them into distorted, extended, and merged forms. This opens new avenues for portraiture only achievable within a digital playground. Pushing against the limitations of the human body in turn inspires explorations of fashion and wearable art that exist purely in the virtual realm—creations that often make their way into physical space as tangible sculptures that subvert conventional beauty standards.'
