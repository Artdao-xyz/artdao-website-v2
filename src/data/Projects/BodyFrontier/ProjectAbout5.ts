  description: `As a way to build a physical relationship with herself and connect with her identity, Cyshimi extends the conventional limits of nail art, creating performative sculptures that act as extensions of her body.\n\nThrough these pieces, her interaction with everyday objects is fundamentally reimagined, changing how she relates to them in daily life.\n\nShe explores the body and its formal limits between the natural and the artificial, developing new ways of experiencing her surroundings and understanding herself.\nCyshimi also emphasizes that these pieces reshape her identity in return, establishing a reciprocal relationship between artist and creation.`
