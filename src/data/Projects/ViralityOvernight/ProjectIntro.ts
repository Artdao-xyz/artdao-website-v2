		'In the web3 ecosystem, digital artists navigate a fundamental paradox between permanence and vitality. With one hand, they engage a blockchain that derives its authority from immutable, decentralized records; with the other, they respond to an attention economy driven by novelty and hype.',
		'The friction between artwork that endures and artwork that spreads presents an existential dilemma for creators working in NFTs and other tokenized formats. In this landscape, virality transcends its usual associations with meaningless seepage—it can instead fuel more enduring engines of meaning-making. Emerging digital art must continuously negotiate this tension between the fast and slow construction of meaning.'
