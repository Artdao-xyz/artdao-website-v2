        'The meme is a core building block of digital culture—shaping how information spreads, how language evolves, and how humor, critique, and identity move online. More than a communicative shortcut, the meme has become an aesthetic and political agent embedded in everyday meaning-making.',
        'Meme art goes beyond internet humor. It\'s a form of visual expression that blurs lines between high culture and digital exchange, reflecting life that is fragmented, fast, and deeply networked.',
        'Memes depend on participation. They ask viewers to complete a gesture, get a reference, or contribute a variation. This structure echoes conceptual art, where the idea outweighs the object. Memes invite emotional and intellectual response without needing specialized knowledge.',
        'Once in circulation, memes rarely vanish. The internet becomes a terrain of remix and reuse—a landscape where throwaway images gain surprising longevity through constant reactivation.'
