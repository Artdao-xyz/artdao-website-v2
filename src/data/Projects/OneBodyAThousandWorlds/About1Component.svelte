		A character-world is not a story built around a figure, but a system generated through one. It names a practice in which a recurring character functions as an organizing intelligence rather than a narrative subject. The world does not exist first and then receive the character; it unfolds through the character's repeated presence, decisions, gestures, and constraints.

		Within a character-world, the figure operates as a relay between inner states and external structures. It absorbs affect, memory, politics, and speculation, translating them into form across time and media. Meaning emerges through duration and return rather than resolution. The character is not developed toward an endpoint, nor refined into a brand. It is used, stressed, and re-entered as a way of thinking spatially, emotionally, and ethically.

	<p>
		Character-worlds privilege continuity over plot and recurrence over climax. They allow artists to work through complexity without flattening it into narrative clarity. The figure becomes a living site of inquiry—one that can mutate, fail, or contradict itself—while still holding the world together.
