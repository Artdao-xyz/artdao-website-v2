		Drawing on his experience growing up as a villero in working-class neighborhoods, Turro rejects the art world's tendency to victimize the working class. Instead, he builds a universe where pleasure, desire, luxury, and the small joys of everyday life take center stage.

		With references to surrealism and scenes from his own life, he develops his namesake character not as an alter ego, but as a symbolic figure—an aesthetic and narrative anchor that speaks to many. Through this character, he refines his technique and builds a quiet, enduring intimacy with the viewer.
