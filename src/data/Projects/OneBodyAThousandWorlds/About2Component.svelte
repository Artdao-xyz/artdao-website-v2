		Salawaki is a digital artist working across 3D, NFTs, and internet culture, blending humor, parody, memes, vulnerability, and fragments of daily life. Her work explores personal growth and self-image, focusing on the trivialities of everyday experience. She approaches confusion, mental chaos, and emotional hypersensitivity with sharp self-irony.

		In her video-based pieces, Mirjam appears through a raw digital avatar and a recurring alter ego: a (nearly) ever-present trout that absurdly—and endearingly—symbolizes her inner world.

		Her process often begins with an obsessive focus on a single idea, embracing the risk of getting lost along the way while never forgetting to laugh at herself. From there, she constructs a visual language that merges performance, digital media, and introspection, where collapse and tenderness exist side by side.
