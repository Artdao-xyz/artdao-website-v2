	text: "“Before incorporating VR I worked only with simple geometries and few polygons. A little because of the limitations of my computer at that time, another little because the parts of the process in which I prefer to spend my time are sketching, ideas and composing. The moment of modeling is not as pleasant to me as the moment of putting together a scenario and finding something to fill the gaps. Before, the shapes were dictated by economics: do it quickly and make it read: rabbit, crocodile, axe, if I already made it, recycle it... The same cylinder could act as a lantern, a sun, a bracelet and a barrel. Although those shapes were not lacking in design, it wasn't until VR that I began to explore how the geometries could be interesting in their own right and find joy in modeling. It's easy to play around with VR, quickly create intricate, twisted, imperfect volumes, iterate, test positions, stretch and arrange, cut and patch. There is no work in which I do not use it, even if it is only at the end. I continue using simple geometries, now as placeholders. I create some cubes and cylinders and within Blender I move them, find their size, duplicate them... And I put together a list: 'when I put on the helmet I have to make some boots for it, a helmet, a hilt for the sword...' The same with the helmet. I throw some spheres and stretch them, move them until I find a fold that I like. I'll do it again but a little better. I make the list, one thing after another and return to Blender to continue arranging.”"

	text: '“Sculpting in virtual reality for me has been like rediscovering the sensitivity of the pencil and the hand, but this time with virtual tools. Unlike traditional 3D modeling, which starts with hard and primitive shapes, virtual reality allows me to work more organically and fluidly. This approach restores sensitivity to the creative process and has made me connect with the art of sculpture in a profound way. Coming face to face with the sculpted work helps me better understand its topology and three-dimensionality, being able to interact directly with the digital matter, molding it, enlarging it or reducing it with my virtual hands. Additionally, its versatility and speed allow me to complete jobs more quickly. Something I like is that in virtual reality modeling programs the term "Clay" or "clay" is used. This connects the concept of organic and terrestrial matter with modeled digital matter. For me, it is a nice way to link the traditional and the technological, offering infinite creative possibilities.”'

	text: "Parsa Mostaghim's artistic journey began as a painter, but he soon faced a significant challenge: lack of storage space. For nearly eight years, he accumulated physical works, which eventually became overwhelming. This constraint led Parsa to explore digital art and NFTs, revolutionizing his creative process. The transition offered him unlimited storage and newfound freedom. Parsa explains, “A disk with two terabytes is something magical because I can save all the works that I produce and I also can send them to anywhere in the world -- I was lacking storage for my old physical works and I had to put some of them in trash.” His new studio and home still showcase some of his old paintings and sculptures, serving as a reminder of his artistic evolution. The change in medium had a profound impact on his artistic practice, completely transforming his approach to creation. In 2024, Parsa decided to fully immerse himself in digital art while simultaneously revisiting his college days through a new project called “Clown Boy.” This series represents a nostalgic yet innovative return to self-portraiture, blending his past and present artistic sensibilities. Describing the project, Parsa states, Clown Boy is one of the most evil things that I can create. Each painting is a new adventure, almost like a comic book.” This new chapter in Parsa's career demonstrates his ability to adapt and evolve as an artist, embracing new technologies while honoring his artistic roots."
