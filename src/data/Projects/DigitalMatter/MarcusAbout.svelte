		“Before incorporating VR I worked only with simple geometries and few polygons. A little because
		of the limitations of my computer at that time, another little because the parts of the process
		in which I prefer to spend my time are sketching, ideas and composing. The moment of modeling is
		not as pleasant to me as the moment of putting together a scenario and finding something to fill
		the gaps.

		Before, the shapes were dictated by economics: do it quickly and make it read: rabbit,
		crocodile, axe, if I already made it, recycle it... The same cylinder could act as a lantern, a
		sun, a bracelet and a barrel. Although those shapes were not lacking in design, it wasn't until
		VR that I began to explore how the geometries could be interesting in their own right and find
		joy in modeling.

		It's easy to play around with VR, quickly create intricate, twisted, imperfect volumes, iterate,
		test positions, stretch and arrange, cut and patch. There is no work in which I do not use it,
		even if it is only at the end. I continue using simple geometries, now as placeholders. I create
		some cubes and cylinders and within Blender I move them, find their size, duplicate them... And
		I put together a list: "when I put on the helmet I have to make some boots for it, a helmet, a
		hilt for the sword..." The same with the helmet. I throw some spheres and stretch them, move
		them until I find a fold that I like. I'll do it again but a little better. I make the list, one
		thing after another and return to Blender to continue arranging.”
