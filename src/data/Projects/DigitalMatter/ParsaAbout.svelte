		Parsa Mostaghim's artistic journey began as a painter, but he soon faced a significant
		challenge: lack of storage space. For nearly eight years, he accumulated physical works, which
		eventually became overwhelming. This constraint led Parsa to explore digital art and NFTs,
		revolutionizing his creative process. The transition offered him unlimited storage and newfound
		freedom.

		Parsa explains, "A disk with two terabytes is something magical because I can save all the works
		that I produce and I also can send them to anywhere in the world -- I was lacking storage for my
		old physical works and I had to put some of them in trash." His new studio and home still
		showcase some of his old paintings and sculptures, serving as a reminder of his artistic
		evolution. The change in medium had a profound impact on his artistic practice, completely
		transforming his approach to creation.

		In 2024, Parsa decided to fully immerse himself in digital art while simultaneously revisiting
		his college days through a new project called "Clown Boy." This series represents a nostalgic
		yet innovative return to self-portraiture, blending his past and present artistic sensibilities.
		Describing the project, Parsa states, "Clown Boy is one of the most evil things that I can
		create. Each painting is a new adventure, almost like a comic book." This new chapter in Parsa's
		career demonstrates his ability to adapt and evolve as an artist, embracing new technologies
		while honoring his artistic roots.
