		Starting his artistic practice as a painter, Parsa Mostaghim faced the challenge of limited
		physical space to store his growing collection of artworks. This constraint led him to explore

		transformation reinvigorated his creative spirit, inspiring him to explore the revolutionary
		possibilities of digital creation.
