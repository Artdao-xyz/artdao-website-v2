		Parsa Mostaghim’s artistic evolution began as a painter, but the limitations of physical storage
		pushed him to embrace digital art and sculpting. This transition not only offered him unlimited
		space but also a newfound freedom to create without constraints. In the digital realm, Parsa
		discovered the ability to sculpt and manipulate forms in a fluid environment, allowing him to
		iterate and innovate with ease.

	<p>
		With his digital practice, Parsa can work on-the-go — whether sitting on the couch or traveling
		by bus — leading to increased productivity and efficiency. This flexibility contrasts sharply
		with his previous experience as a full-time painter, where each action on canvas would take
		hours to change if he wanted to. Now, with the click of a button, he can experiment and refine
		his creations, unlocking a more spontaneous and dynamic approach to his artistry.
