		'In an era where time feels compressed and space infinitely expansive, we spoke with Parsa, Sulkian, and Marcus3Dâ€”artists navigating the fluid boundary between physical and virtual realms. Their work escapes traditional forms, thriving instead in virtual landscapes where VR serves as a sculpting tool and digital matter forms to their creative will.',
		'In the infinite possibilities of space provided by Virtual Reality, these artists find the possibility of creating digital sculptures as an artistic practice of rapid execution where their gestures open doors to a malleability of objects across different realities.'
