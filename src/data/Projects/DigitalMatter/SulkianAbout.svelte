		“Sculpting in virtual reality for me has been like rediscovering the sensitivity of the pencil
		and the hand, but this time with virtual tools. Unlike traditional 3D modeling, which starts
		with hard and primitive shapes, virtual reality allows me to work more organically and fluidly.
	</p>
	<p>
		This approach restores sensitivity to the creative process and has made me connect with the art
		of sculpture in a profound way. Coming face to face with the sculpted work helps me better
		understand its topology and three-dimensionality, being able to interact directly with the
		digital matter, molding it, enlarging it or reducing it with my virtual hands. Additionally, its
		versatility and speed allow me to complete jobs more quickly.

		Something I like is that in virtual reality modeling programs the term "Clay" or "clay" is used.
		This connects the concept of organic and terrestrial matter with modeled digital matter. For me,
		it is a nice way to link the traditional and the technological, offering infinite creative
		possibilities.”
